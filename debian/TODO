* Upgrade issues

Issues that arise when upgrading from the unsplit Debian syslog-ng
from Squeeze (direct upgrades from earlier are not supported, and will
not be), and between split versions.

** Upgrading from syslog-ng-module-* to syslog-ng-mod-*

*** lintian warns on the unversioned Breaks

The unversioned Breaks: is probably not needed. Will need to test with
plain Conflicts.

** Test upgrades from one major version to the other

Test what happens when we move from libsyslog-ng-3.3.1 to -3.3.2 or
even to -3.4. The expected scenario is that the old library gets
removed automatically.

* Packaging improvements

** Proper Ubuntu Lucid support

Lucid doesn't like data.tar.xz at all, and since I use the same meta
package on all distributions, that one should be a data.tar.gz.

That is, when building the syslog-ng package, use dh_builddeb, without
extra arguments.

** systemd support

Systemd support is currently explicitly disabled. On Linux, it should
be enabled, and syslog-ng-core should ship with an appropriate service
file.
