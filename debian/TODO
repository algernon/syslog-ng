* Upgrade issues

Issues that arise when upgrading from the unsplit Debian syslog-ng
from Squeeze (direct upgrades from earlier are not supported, and will
not be).

** Logcheck

A similar problem exists with logcheck, but I do not know the
consequences of having both syslog-ng and syslog-ng-core logchecks at
the moment.

** Upgrading from non-split to split does not restart syslog-ng

I've seen this on a few systems, not sure why this happens, but it
needs to be investigated.

* Packaging improvements

** Split libsyslog-ng0 out of syslog-ng-core

The reason for this is that when building third party modules, one
does not need syslog-ng itself, it does not need to run. Thus,
build-depending on the full syslog-ng-core, which replaces the syslogd
would be a silly idea.

This split will also make lintian happier.

TODO: Talk to upstream about it (mail sent to syslog-ng@ list
already), and figure out the SONAME issues.

** Fix syslog-ng-dev (and possibly rename it to libsyslog-ng-dev)

We need the ivykis headers installed too, and proper dependencies
added. That involves going through the headers and seeing what we
expose.

The devel package, whatever the name will be, can be worked on even
while the SONAME issues aren't solved, as we'll only have to rename
the package then, and everything else will be fine already.

** DEP-5 debian/copyright

There's quite a lot of work to do with regards to documenting the
copyright and licenses of various parts of syslog-ng. So this task
will be a bit of a pain.

Needs to be done, nevertheless.
