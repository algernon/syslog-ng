* Upgrade issues

Issues that arise when upgrading from the unsplit Debian syslog-ng
from Squeeze (direct upgrades from earlier are not supported, and will
not be).

** Upgrading from non-split to split, various issues

*** Config file is not always preserved between upgrades.

Need to test this extensively. I had cases where the config file was
preserved, and others were it was silently overwritten.

*** Verify that upgrading from squeeze syslog-ng restarts correctly.

The split version is using triggers to restart, it needs to be
verified that it behaves correctly in all cases.

* Packaging improvements

** systemd support

Systemd support is currently explicitly disabled. On Linux, it should
be enabled, and syslog-ng-core should ship with an appropriate service
file.

* Bug triaging

Go over the open bugs against syslog-ng, and see which are fixed with
the repackaging, and which still remain open.
