* Packaging improvements

** xconsole

Figure out what to do on GNU/kFreeBSD: where's xconsole there, and how
should our config support that? Or in other words, do we need to
create /dev/xconsole, or symlink it from somewhere else, or..?

** systemd support

Apart from the service file, we don't need anything else, so this can
probably go in. Not into the autobuilt packages, though.
