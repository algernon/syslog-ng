* Upgrade issues

Issues that arise when upgrading from the unsplit Debian syslog-ng
from Squeeze (direct upgrades from earlier are not supported, and will
not be).

** Upgrading from non-split to split, various issues

*** Config file is not always preserved between upgrades.

Need to test this extensively. I had cases where the config file was
preserved, and others were it was silently overwritten.

* Packaging improvements

** libsyslog-ng

Upstream will add a -release tag to libtool, so the package will end
up being libsyslog-ng3.3.0beta2-0 (and libsyslog-ng-dev).

Packaging is done, but -release is not patched in yet.

* Bug triaging

Go over the open bugs against syslog-ng, and see which are fixed with
the repackaging, and which still remain open.
