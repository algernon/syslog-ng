Description: Next generation system logging daemon (metapackage)
 syslog-ng is an enhanced syslog daemon, supporting, amongst others:
  * Powerful configurability, while still being readable
  * Filtering on any part of the syslog message
  * Support for both legacy BSD and the new syslog protocol
  * Wide range of source and destination drivers, including TCP
    (plain, or over SSL/TLS), UDP, SQL, MongoDB
