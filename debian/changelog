syslog-ng (3.3.0beta2-1~preview1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update syslog-ng.conf to be fully 3.3 compliant.
  * Add support for GNU/kFreeBSD in the SCL system() generator.
  * Fixed the logrotate config file installation, so that upgrades from
    non-split syslog-ng becomes smooth. (This breaks upgrades from split
    ones, but that's ok)
  * Do restart syslog-ng properly upon upgrade from non-split version.
  * Simplified the logrotate file by merging identical entries.
  * Include local configuration files from /etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/ (Closes:
    #609050).
  * Split out libsyslog-ng (as libsyslog-ng0 for now).
  * Update debian/copyright to DEP-5 format.
