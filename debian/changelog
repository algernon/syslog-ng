syslog-ng (3.3.1-1~mhp2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename module packages to syslog-ng-mod-*. The new modules conflict &
    break with the old ones, hopefully leading to a straight upgrade path.
  * Support 'status' in the init script.
    Patch from Peter Eisentraut <petere@debian.org> (Closes: #644458)
  * Build-Depend on libevtlog-dev (>= 0.2.12-5~) for correct shlibs.
  * Build-Depend on lsb-release, and use it to disable xz compression on
    Ubuntu Lucid.

  * Update syslog-ng.conf to be fully 3.3 compliant.
